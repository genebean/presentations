I organized and lead the Birds of a Feather session at Puppet's annual conference in 2019. This included soliciting topics from our community, helping curate the submissions, and acting as MC during the event. Below is the session description from the event website:

> A Birds of a Feather session (BoF for short) is an informal, fun gathering to discuss a shared interest or identity. Gene Liverman and friends will facilitate topic-based table discussions.
>
> Table topics include: 
>
> - Patching Automation & Compliance-as-Code  chat about patching systems and ensuring they are configured to meet regulatory requirements
> - The DevOps Toolbox  chat about the tools you use beside those authored by Puppet
> - Upgrading to the Latest Modules  chat about how you upgrade highly depended-on modules like stdlib without having the world come crashing down around you
> - Community Potholes  Chat about things in puppet-land that we can do better.
> - Combining Desired State & Ad-Hoc Tools  chat about how you are getting the best of both worlds and what tools you are using
> - And more!
